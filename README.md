# Algorithm Visualiser
Web application that visualises various algorithms. Sorting and graph algorithms are available where users can provide and tweak the input (i.e. build your own network graph where you can move nodes around). 

In the future I want to make this project more unique by visualizing less common algorithms such as Delauney triangulation. 

## Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
